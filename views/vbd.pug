    h1.mt-5 Virtual Biospecimen Discovery (VBD)
    h4 
        small Website developed to connect researchers and biospecimens at UC Davis Medical Center
    
    h3.mt-3 Background
    p 
    | At UC Davis, biobanks have historically been siloed, with any given biobank not knowing what other biobanks store in their freezers. 
    | One of the key goals of the Biorepositories Core Resource (BCR) at UCD is to connect these biobanks and give 
    | researchers greater access to the specimens they need for their studies. The VBD tool serves as a "matchmaker", 
    | providing basic filtering on demographic and specimen details that allows researchers to determine which biobanks
    | may have samples to share. Querying the VBD database returns a table of matching specimens grouped by biobank, 
    | with contact information for the researcher to use.
    h3.mt-3 Purpose
    p 
    | I created the VBD as part of my role as biobanking programmer for UC Davis Medical Center. 
    | The website is a tool for researchers to locate and obtain specimens stored by other biobanks at UC Davis. 
    p
    | My responsibilities include design, development, testing, and documentation of the back-end, 
    | front-end and database for the website. Additionally, I manage the ETL process for all biobanks importing specimen data
    | into the VBD database.

            li <b>Simple to use</b>: do not clutter the VBD with unnecessary pages and actions. 
            li <b>Fast</b>: researchers often have multiple grants and studies going on at the same time. 
            li <b>Visually appealing</b>: the website should have a clean, modern design with an easy to use interface.
